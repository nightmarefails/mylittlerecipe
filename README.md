My Little Recipe - Cooking Is MAGIC!!!

Project Description: 

The website allows users to find recipes and save them to a personal account
for later use. Users are also able to rate the saved recipes and submit personal recipes to the site.

User Story: 

As an avid home cook I want to catalogue my favorite recipes as well as recipes I would like to try. When I have saved a recipe I would like to rate it on how easy it was to create and as well as if the food was good. I would also like to label each recipe if it is vegetarian, gluten free, and vegan.
